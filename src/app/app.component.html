            Merry Christmas! I wanted to give you something special and unique for Christmas this year, so I decided to give you YOUR VERY OWN CHRISTMAS WEBSITE!!! HOW EXCITING?! I figured this would be one of those thoughtful gifts that you have always really cherished. I want you to know that your dedication to our family does not go unnoticed. I've gone around social media and collected a handful of photos that show some things that I love most about you. First of all, you have always been there to support all of us in of our accomplishments. Whether it was having a birthday party, graduating, winning (or losing) a game, you were always there! Even when I was little, and you were working your tail off as a nurse, you never missed a single beat. I know that wasn't easy and that you probably wanted to give up sometimes, but you didn't. You achieved your goals, and you've made it possible for me to achieve mine. You're also making that possible for Cannon and Campbell.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3 style="line-height: 1.7em;
          text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px #000000;">
            You've always done your absolute best to make sure we have what we need and more. I've been thinking about all of the effort you've put in over the years for things like halloween costumes, education, elf on a shelf, extra-curricular activies like girl scouts, and more. You are so imaginative and creative, and I love that about you! I literally told someone that my most favorite halloween costume ever was when I was the Wright Brothers. What an incredible costume! You're still crushing it with the kids' costumes, and you and Stacey's costumes are always incredible. The elf-on-a-shelf series that you have been doing over the years has been INSANELY GOOD! I mean that should be going viral, no joke! You've always made sure that we have exciting and beatifully arranged birthday parties. I will always cherish those birthday memories, such as the pirate treasure hunt, the shark theme, and the dance party at the agricenter. You made this all possible!
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3 style="line-height: 1.7em;
          text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px #000000;">
            Another thing I like to point out is your tendency to be charitable. You do so many things like being a part of Junior Auxiliary, Girl Scouts, PTA, and more. Its truly astounding how you find time to do all of this, and sometimes it makes me worried that you are doing to much. However, you always seem to find time and hold everything together. I know that is hard, just like it was when you were working on-call as a nurse. You never give up. You never have, and you never will stop fighting for us. You are the best mom I could've ever asked for. I love you very much, and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

              Many people don't know this... but the elves make an annual pilgrimage to the dangerous Candy Mountain. Candy Mountain is 30 miles west of the North Pole, but the dangerous trip is worth every step! The elves must climb the treacherous gumdrop mountain face in order to reach all of the delicious candies that Santa delivers to all to good boys and girls!
